## Project Summary
For our project, we have a Minecraft agent with a bow and use reinforcement learning to teach it to shoot targets at a distance. Our input is an observation from Malmo indicating the target’s location/distance relative to the agent’s position and rotation. Our output is the actions that the agent takes in that situation (i.e. changes in pitch and yaw) and the result of the actions taken in the given situation. At the time of the status report, we had implemented an agent that could accurately shoot a non-moving target by adjusting both its horizontal and vertical aim for targets on the same elevation as our agent and even targets elevated above our agent.
